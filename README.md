# BayesianNetwork-AI-Homework
This is my ai homework which includes complete enumarition, variable elimination and monte carlo technique


- You can find the homework question [AI_HW2](https://github.com/mehmetozanguven/BayesianNetwork-AI-Homework/blob/master/AI_HW2.pdf)

- According to the bayesian network, I have calculated the some probabilities via

  1. [Complete enumaration](https://github.com/mehmetozanguven/BayesianNetwork-AI-Homework/blob/master/CompleteEnumeration-Q1.pdf)
  2. [Variable elimination](https://github.com/mehmetozanguven/BayesianNetwork-AI-Homework/blob/master/VariableElimination-Q2.pdf)
  
- and also I have calculated these probabilities via [monte carlo technique](https://github.com/mehmetozanguven/BayesianNetwork-AI-Homework/blob/master/monteCarlo-Q3.py)
